"""`highlights broll`: cam-path-only clips for pre-edit build-up, no highlight needed.

Each clip is one of your cam paths recorded over a stretch of live play. `empty` mode only uses
stretches where no living player is in view (establishing shots); `players` mode only uses
stretches where players are in view for most of the clip (the "random people" mode). Windows,
rounds and paths are picked at random (`--seed` repeats a pick). Planned from data only, so
`--json-only` previews everything; recording is one game session per demo.
