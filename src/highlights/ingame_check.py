"""`highlights check-ingame`: record one play in every form and write a checklist of what to look for.

Covers the assumptions the code cannot verify on its own: kill-feed filter and colours, name
replacement, extra commands, cam-path coordinates and `edit start`, held last pose, the generated
face intro, and frame alignment of spliced takes. Each clip is kept raw so a problem is visible.
