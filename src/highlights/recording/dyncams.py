"""Generated cam paths that follow the POV player (--intro-cam, --downtime-cam).

Instead of a user-supplied cam path, the path is computed from the demo: a pose
relative to the player's eye (face, profile, gun, third-person, helicopter) that
eases into the exact first-person eye pose at the end of an opener, or out of and
back into it during down time, so the cut back to the POV take has no jump.
Everything here is pure geometry on clip-second tracks; the demo is only read by
`spatial.sample_pov_tracks`. Offsets are estimates from reference clips and are
meant to be tuned (the constants below); nothing is checked against map geometry,
so a camera can end up inside a wall.

Angles are degrees, CS2 convention: positive yaw turns toward +y, positive pitch
looks down (same as `campaths.parse_campath`).
